# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the caffeine.ai “Built with …” footer/credit from the final end screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete/disable rendering of the end screen footer/credit section containing “Built with”, “caffeine.ai”, or any link to https://caffeine.ai/.
- Ensure the rest of the end screen UI remains unchanged (outcome emoji/message, optional heart row for the “ofc” path, visual effects, and “Start Over” button behavior).

**User-visible outcome:** The end screen no longer shows any caffeine.ai branding or “Built with …” credit, while all existing end-screen content and interactions work the same as before.
